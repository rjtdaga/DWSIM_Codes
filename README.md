The files in the repository are part of the Free and Open Source Software for Education (FOSSEE) DWSIM project undertaken by Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IITB).
The custom models for the unit operations mentioned below were developed as these were not a part of the original DWSIM software and provided users with additional unit operations 
to include in their flowsheets. In addition, these codes allow users to understand coding syntax in the IronPython framework within DWSIM and help the users to create their own custom models.
The following unit operations were developed:
1) Stoichiometric Reactor
2) Cyclone Separator
3) Cross-flow tray dryer
4) Continuous Crystallizer
5) Electrostatic Precipitator
6) Isothermal Batch Reactor
Each folder consists of 3 files: A .pdf file with brief description of the model; A text file with the code of the custom model; A DWSIM flowsheet using the custom model
